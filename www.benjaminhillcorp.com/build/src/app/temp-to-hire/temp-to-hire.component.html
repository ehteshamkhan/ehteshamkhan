<h3>Temp-To-Hire</h3>
<p>Many employers have spent dozens of hours screening, interviewing, and training a new employee, only to find that they’re not the right fit for the company once they’re hired. This can lead to problems throughout your company as lack of productivity and poor morale build. Benjamin Hill’s temp-to-hire services allow you to avoid the hassle associated with finding and screening a candidate, and also gives you a probationary period so that you can be sure your new employee is the right fit for your team. During this probationary period, Benjamin Hill handles payroll for you, so that you only have to complete internal onboarding processes when you’re sure you’ve found a perfect fit.</p>
